A summary of Project:
In this project I had song data which I should make schema and provide it with ETL in sparkifydb database. I creates one fact table, called songsplay and four dimension tables, called atrists, time, users and songs. 

How to run the Python scripts:
I used python scripts for the project and for the code Jupyter Notebook was handy. In order to be sure that all codes are functioning, I wrote all codes and run them in terminal. 

An explanation of the files in the repository:
For the project I had 3 main python scripts (create_tables.py,etl.py,sql_queries.py). In sql_queries.py I droped, created the tables and inserted the data to the tables. Create_tables.py contains the tables that I created. ETL.py was most challanging script for me. There I made pipelines to tables. I created relations from dimension tables to fact table. One more file is test.ipnb which is used to test if tables are working and get the right result that I want to get.
